# Using-a-new-phase-locked-visual-feedback-protocol-to-affirm-simpler-models-for-alpha-dynamics

Using neural dynamic models (Neural mass model, Fixed-point attractor, Limit-cycle attractor, Chaotic strange attractor) to explain the dynamic mechanism of phase-locked visual feedback for closed-loop alpha rhythm modulation.
